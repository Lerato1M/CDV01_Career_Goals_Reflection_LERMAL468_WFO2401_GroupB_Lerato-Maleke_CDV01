    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
    - I want to learn how software development can be used in these fields as I am learning that everything has to be done and excelled from a software development perspective. I am yet        to link the path whereby I deal with a project from code to UI?UX point and what software developers do in tersm of the cloud computing industry.
